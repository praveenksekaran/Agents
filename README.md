ðŸ”‘ Programming Fundamentals
You need to be confident with OOP, functions, classes, and working with APIs. If youâ€™re building full-stack agentic systems, knowing TypeScript is a huge plus.
Start here: https://realpython.com for Python or https://lnkd.in/gZ9e4jgd for TypeScript 

ðŸ”‘ Prompt Engineering for Agents
 Learn how to structure prompts to guide reasoning, decision-making, and tool use. This is what makes or breaks your agent.
Start here: https://lnkd.in/geHd_uf5

ðŸ”‘ Tool & API Integration
Agents donâ€™t just respond, they act. That means wrapping real tools: APIs, calculators, scrapers, databases. Learn how to expose them cleanly so the agent knows how to use them. Only then try using MCP. 
Start here: https://lnkd.in/gx8Qfsx2

ðŸ”‘ Agentic System Design 
Build simple linear workflows before diving into multi-agent systems. 
Study the most common design patterns and try to implement them with Python only, before using any frameworks.
Start here: https://lnkd.in/g8jBUVKn

ðŸ”‘ Evals 
 You canâ€™t improve what you donâ€™t measure. Set up tracing for your agents. Choose 3-5 metrics you care about. Build an LLM as a judge. And continuously improve.
